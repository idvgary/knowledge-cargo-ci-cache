# Approaches

This category owns strategy selection, combinations, and tradeoffs. [Decisions](../decisions/README.md) owns adoption status, [Providers](../providers/README.md) maps strategies to services and their blog posts, and [cache layers](../concepts/cache-layers.md) explains how the mechanisms combine.

Apply the [open-source, direct GitHub Actions scope](../README.md#scope-and-applicability) before implementing a branch. Provider services and other-platform examples supply research ideas; listing them here does not make their hosted implementation an adoption candidate.

```

Follow the relevant route below. This flow chooses an experiment, not a universal winner. On RunsOn, use the [quickstart](../quickstart.md) and [deployment map](../deployments/runs-on/README.md) for the current practical starting point. For source-mtime rebuilds, use [freshness diagnosis](../operations/diagnosing-rebuilds.md); the [content-fingerprint alternative](../research/cargo-freshness-alternatives.md) remains a nightly experiment.

For named implementations use [Tools](../tools/README.md); for where their state lives use [storage topologies](../concepts/storage-topologies.md).

## CI strategy map

These families cover the reusable mechanisms represented in this archive, including optimizations that reduce work without being caches. Provider pages identify the documented deployment and source limits; an absent provider entry means not assessed.

## Compatibility Rule

Do not combine archive and native-state owners for the same Cargo paths. See the [canonical path ownership rule](../concepts/cargo-path-coverage.md#compatibility-rule-canonical). Tool setup and a compiler cache can complement one another; two tools competing for `RUSTC_WRAPPER` need explicitly supported and tested composition.

## Architecture Diagrams

Keep diagrams beside the canonical explanation of the behavior they represent:

- [`rust-cache` with source-keyed full target cache](rust-cache-source-keyed-target-cache.md#architecture)
- [S3-backed `sccache`](../tools/sccache.md#design)
