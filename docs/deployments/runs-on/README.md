# RunsOn Deployment Map

This page maps the repository's cache approaches onto RunsOn. It owns RunsOn runner prerequisites, Magic Cache, direct S3 `sccache`, sticky-disk behavior, and the boundary with the archived EBS snapshot approach. Generic Cargo tradeoffs remain in [Approaches](../../approaches/README.md).

Do not combine archive-managed and sticky/snapshot-managed ownership of the same Cargo paths. The canonical compatibility rule is in [Cargo Path Coverage](../../concepts/cargo-path-coverage.md#compatibility-rule-canonical).

## Version Boundary

Live documentation and release-source review: September 6, 2026. The latest published releases checked through the GitHub API were [RunsOn v3.2.3](https://github.com/runs-on/runs-on/releases/tag/v3.2.3) and [action v2.3.1](https://github.com/runs-on/action/releases/tag/v2.3.1). This review did not deploy either version or repeat the archived benchmarks. The [provider source map](../../providers/runs-on.md) lists the language, cache, storage, runner, and maintenance pages checked.

- Sticky disks require RunsOn v3.2.0 or newer.
- [RunsOn v2 is scheduled to enter critical-fixes-only support after September 15, 2026](https://runs-on.com/blog/runson-v2-deprecation/). Treat the v3 migration as a separate infrastructure project with a parallel stack, representative workflow tests, and a rollback window.
- `runs-on/action@v2` resolved to v2.3.1 at this review and exposes sticky-disk and S3 `sccache` configuration, including Windows sccache support. The released action metadata defaults `sticky_wait_timeout` to `15m`, while the sticky-disk documentation still mentions five minutes; set the timeout explicitly.

Do not couple the immediate Rust cache choice to a rushed platform migration. Establish the clean-target baseline first, upgrade independently, then test sticky storage.

## Magic Cache Input-Only Baseline

Magic Cache replaces the backend used by compatible `actions/cache` calls. It improves transport and capacity characteristics, but cached paths are still archived, downloaded, extracted, cleaned by their owning action, and saved as new immutable objects.

The workflow shapes here use Flex per-job labels. For Fleet, configure the capability in the Terraform runner catalog and target the named fleet from workflow YAML; do not copy Flex resource labels into a Fleet job.

Use this order:

1. Select a runner with `extras=s3-cache`.
2. Run `runs-on/action@v2` before any action that uses the cache protocol.
3. Check out normally; source-mtime preservation is unnecessary when `target/` starts clean.
4. Set up Rust and helper tools.
5. Restore Cargo registry and Git inputs with `cache-targets: false` as the pragmatic default, or omit this step for the no-cache control.
6. Build into an ephemeral local target directory.

The input-only settings are:

```yaml
env:
  CARGO_INCREMENTAL: "0"

steps:
  - uses: runs-on/action@v2

  - uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2
    with:
      prefix-key: rust-inputs-v1
      cache-targets: false
      cache-bin: false
      cache-all-crates: false
      save-if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
```

Use a fresh prefix when cutting over from target caching. Keep PR jobs restore-only and use one trusted canonical writer. This is the low-risk default for most projects because it avoids mutable target persistence. If input-only setup is effectively tied with normal dependency downloads, remove the Rust cache and keep the simpler no-cache baseline.

`jdx/mise-action` can continue to cache Rust, Zig, and helper-tool setup through Magic Cache. Keep `MISE_DATA_DIR` stable, keep Cargo credentials out of it, and do not treat setup-tool caching as Cargo target freshness.

## Direct S3 `sccache`

RunsOn can export the S3 backend environment and `RUSTC_WRAPPER` for `sccache`:

```yaml
- name: Export RunsOn S3 sccache environment
  uses: runs-on/action@v2
  with:
    sccache: s3

- name: Override RunsOn sccache namespace
  shell: bash
  run: echo "SCCACHE_S3_KEY_PREFIX=cache/sccache/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY_ID}/${RUNNER_OS}-${RUNNER_ARCH}/rust-v1" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"

- uses: Mozilla-Actions/sccache-action@v0.0.11
  with:
    version: v0.17.0
```

With `sccache: s3`, the RunsOn action exports `SCCACHE_BUCKET`, `SCCACHE_REGION`, the stack-wide default `SCCACHE_S3_KEY_PREFIX=cache/sccache`, `SCCACHE_GHA_ENABLED=false`, and `RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache`. The explicit namespace step is not configuring the backend again; it overrides only `SCCACHE_S3_KEY_PREFIX` to isolate objects by repository, platform, and cache schema. The RunsOn action does not install the `sccache` executable, so keep a separate pinned installer.

The open [sccache-prefix PR #58](https://github.com/runs-on/action/pull/58) proposes an input for this override and a scoped default; `sccache_prefix` is absent from released v2.3.1. Keep the explicit environment step until adopting a release that includes the input. Apply overrides before the installer or any command starts the daemon; a running daemon retains its startup configuration.

Keep `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, leave `target/` on local runner storage, print statistics on every canary, and use a repository/platform/schema-specific prefix instead of the stack-wide default.

The canonical canary does not also run `Swatinem/rust-cache`. Earlier default-server, client-side, read-only, and multilevel measurements included its input-only archive, while the later default-server ablation omitted it. Removing the archive preserved 6,929 compiler-cache hits with zero misses and was directionally faster, although the single cross-family run is not enough to establish a stable effect size or prove direct interference. Keep the mechanisms separate by default and add Cargo-input caching only when measured registry or Git download savings exceed its archive and action overhead in the complete job.

Direct S3 access is not governed by Magic Cache protocol isolation. `SCCACHE_S3_RW_MODE=READ_ONLY` constrains the `sccache` process, but it is not an infrastructure trust boundary: arbitrary workflow code can still use any broader S3 permissions attached to the runner. Enforce untrusted PR read-only behavior with IAM, a separate stack/role, or an equivalent boundary before sharing a writable namespace.

Confirm lifecycle expiry, request volume, object growth, cache errors, and rollback to direct `rustc`. Adopt the compiler cache from representative end-to-end time and cost, not hit rate alone.

## Sticky-Disk Options

RunsOn now provides [managed sticky disks](https://runs-on.com/docs/runners/capabilities/sticky-disks/) for the EBS approach: a per-job native filesystem is restored and preserved through EBS snapshots, avoiding tar/zstd archive extraction and recompression. The current documentation positions this as the successor to `runs-on/snapshot@v1`; the archive's [custom snapshot implementation](../../approaches/ebs-snapshot.md) remains separate historical evidence. The disk is bounded by its configured size, but Cargo artifacts can still accumulate until cleanup or reset.

The runner requests a named disk lineage with an illustrative size:

```yaml
runs-on:
  - runs-on=${{ github.run_id }}
  - cpu=16
  - image=ubuntu24-full-x64
  - sticky=rust-inputs-v1:20gb
```

The built-in Cargo-input mode persists only Cargo registry and Git paths:

```yaml
- uses: runs-on/action@v2
  with:
    sticky_cache: rust
    sticky_wait_timeout: 15m
```

It does not persist workspace `target/`. A custom target experiment must opt in explicitly:

```yaml
- uses: runs-on/action@v2
  with:
    sticky_cache: |
      rust
      custom,path=sticky-target
    sticky_wait_timeout: 15m
```

Run the action after checkout when a custom path is relative to the GitHub workspace. Keep source paths stable and preserve or account for source mtimes before judging target reuse.

Before enabling a custom target:

- Measure target bytes and file count across source, lockfile, feature, profile, and toolchain changes.
- Monitor free bytes and inodes, and define warning, reset, and maximum-utilization thresholds.
- Serialize or deliberately partition writers because concurrent jobs start from independent snapshots and the newest completed clean-unmount snapshot becomes the next restore point.
- Test successful, failed, and cancelled jobs, disk wait failures, default-branch fallback, and reset behavior.
- Keep the sticky disk as the sole owner of the target and Cargo-input paths it mounts.

The dense lineage, fallback, expiry, free-space, and last-writer semantics are in [RunsOn Cache And Disk Details](../../reference/runson-cache-and-disk-details.md). A [proposed Cargo sticky-disk workflow](../../research/runs-on-sccache/sticky-cargo-canary.yml) is retained under research and has not been benchmarked. Use it only after verifying the required platform, trusted writer, capacity, and lifecycle controls; promote a copyable canary into the main examples together with its first measurements.

For missing storage, distinguish explicit cold fallback from setup errors using the [v2.3.1 failure contract](../../reference/runson-cache-and-disk-details.md#sticky-disk-failure-boundary). These source checks do not qualify a managed sticky-target benchmark.

## Conditional Whole-Target Archives

Magic Cache can still back a whole-target `rust-cache` or separate `actions/cache` entry, but the backend does not make a growing target archive cheap to serialize.

Use whole-target archives only when:

- Source and build identity are included in the restore lineage.
- There is no broad target fallback across changed source, lockfile, profile, feature, target, toolchain, or compiler-wrapper state.
- One trusted canonical job writes the lineage.
- Compressed bytes, target bytes, file count, restore time, and save time remain bounded and cheaper than recompilation.

Restricting saves to the default branch does not fix a large restore: every reader still downloads and extracts it, and the canonical writer can keep rolling it forward. More backend capacity, shorter object retention, and namespace rotation also do not prune files inside the active archive.

## Archived EBS Snapshot Alternative

The local [EBS snapshot approach](../../approaches/ebs-snapshot.md) remains the strongest measured option for complete Cargo no-op fidelity because it preserves the workspace, Cargo home, target, and related filesystem state together. It also requires custom EC2/EBS permissions, snapshot retention, clean mount/unmount handling, concurrency control, and credential scrubbing.

The optional `EnableStickyDiskIsolation` / `enable_stickydisk_isolation` setting removes the runner EBS permissions this legacy action needs. Migrate legacy workflows before enabling it; managed sticky disks continue through control-plane-owned EBS operations.

Prefer supported sticky disks for new post-v3.2 experiments. Keep the local snapshot action as archived evidence and as an explicit fallback when its additional lifecycle control is required.

## Storage And Isolation Notes

Use the [storage topology reference](../../concepts/storage-topologies.md) for the generic model and the [RunsOn storage details](../../reference/runson-cache-and-disk-details.md#runner-local-and-shared-storage) for platform-specific mount paths, lifetime, and availability.

- Local instance-store NVMe suits a disposable target with remote compiler objects. It survives reboot but loses data on stop/termination; an NVMe device name alone does not prove instance-store backing.
- Linux `extras=tmpfs` takes precedence over automatic NVMe placement and competes with compilation for RAM. It provides no cross-job durability by itself.
- EFS is an explicitly enabled Linux Flex shared filesystem. Verify that it is mounted before writing; the docs describe a missing/disabled mount as silently skipped.
- Magic Cache isolation and sticky-disk isolation are separate opt-ins. The former scopes protocol credentials; the latter removes legacy runner EBS authority. Neither turns direct S3 prefixes into an IAM boundary.
- Never persist Cargo registry credentials, cloud credentials, or tokens on a sticky or snapshotted path. Scrub credential-bearing files before a save-capable post step.

## Ownership And Maintenance

This page owns RunsOn-specific deltas only. Cache selection lives in [Approaches](../../approaches/README.md), current conclusions live in [Decisions](../../decisions/README.md), tool setup lives in [Mise Tool Setup](../../operations/mise-tool-setup.md), and measurement procedure lives in [Measuring Cache Performance](../../operations/measuring-cache-performance.md).

Before changing this deployment map, verify the current RunsOn stack requirement, runner-label syntax, `runs-on/action` major and metadata, Magic Cache isolation behavior, sticky-disk lifecycle, `sccache` helper behavior, and S3 IAM/lifecycle assumptions. Record behavior changes according to the [maintenance checklist](../../operations/maintenance-checklist.md).
