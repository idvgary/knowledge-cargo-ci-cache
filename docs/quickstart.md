## Recommended Default

For GitHub Actions Rust builds, start with:

- A clean local `target/`.
- RunsOn Magic Cache with input-only `Swatinem/rust-cache` as the pragmatic default when RunsOn is available.
- No Rust cache as the paired control.
- `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` for a later `sccache` comparison.
- `mise-action` when repeated Rust, Zig, or helper-tool setup is material.

This shape is low-risk because it keeps tool setup and dependency downloads reusable without persisting mutable target state. Prefer no Rust cache when input-only setup is effectively tied with normal dependency downloads. For frequently changing PR workloads, canary S3-backed `sccache` and Mr. Boxington object mode with mbx 1.12.0 or newer and action 1.4.0 or newer. In the controlled measurement here, directory-backed object mode finished seven seconds ahead of sccache. Add a separate Cargo-input archive only when dependency-download timing justifies it. Mr. Boxington target mode was faster through a different target-state mechanism. The canonical decision record is [Decisions](decisions/README.md).

## When To Escalate

Use a whole-target archive only when a narrow stable workload has exact source/build lineage, one trusted writer, no broad target fallback, and a small monitored archive whose restore/save is cheaper than recompilation.

After RunsOn v3.2, test sticky Cargo inputs before a custom sticky target. Keep EBS/filesystem snapshots as the highest-fidelity archived alternative when lifecycle complexity is acceptable. Do not use S3 Files for Cargo target no-op state based on this archive's experiments.

## Mental Model

Cargo can skip compilation only when source inputs, source mtimes, workspace paths, target artifacts, dep-info, fingerprints, build-script outputs, dependency source paths, toolchain, flags, profile, features, and relevant environment agree with each other.

The short explanation is [Cargo Freshness Model](concepts/cargo-freshness-model.md). The detailed signal table is [Cargo Freshness Signals](reference/cargo-freshness-signals.md).

For other compiler wrappers, see the [qualified Mr. Boxington approach](tools/mr-boxington.md) and [untested Kache entry](reference/vendor-ci-cache-sources.md#kache-not-tested). Provider documentation and blog posts live in the [ecosystem catalog](reference/vendor-ci-cache-sources.md); proposed RunsOn improvements live under [Research](research/README.md).
