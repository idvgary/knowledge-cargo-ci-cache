# Documentation

The documentation is organized by reader need first, then by ownership. Put information in one category and link to it from the others instead of repeating it. This page owns the full reader-routing table and page conventions; category indexes own their focused page lists.

## Scope and applicability

Practical implementations in this repository target **open-source components running directly in GitHub Actions**, including container builds invoked by a GitHub Actions job. Keep the implementation, action/client, storage backend, and provider control plane distinct: an open-source wrapper does not make a hosted service open source, and a paid infrastructure dependency does not by itself determine the license of the client code.

Research coverage is deliberately broader. Preserve useful documentation from commercial/closed providers, other CI/build platforms, upstream issues, experimental implementations, and unstable Cargo features. Record the transferable mechanism and the dependency that prevents using that exact implementation in the practical scope. Source inclusion is not adoption, endorsement, or a request to migrate CI platforms.

For each new technique, identify applicability (direct GitHub Actions implementation, provider-dependent reference, other-platform reference, or unstable experiment), evidence class, reviewed version/date, constraints, and the primary sources. Keep untested candidates visible. The [provider index](providers/README.md) owns vendor coverage; [research](research/README.md) owns unimplemented designs and unstable-feature qualification. Expand these collections as new mechanisms or evidence appear, without claiming the catalog is exhaustive.

## Evidence and retrieval

Use [Decisions](decisions/README.md) to identify the adopted or experimental status, then retrieve the relevant approach and evidence. Treat measured results, pinned implementation observations, reasoned inferences, and proposed designs as different claim classes. Always carry a measurement's versions, workload, cache state, sample count, and limitations into an answer. Use [provider profiles](providers/README.md) for first-party documentation and blog posts and [tool profiles](tools/compiler-caches.md) for explicitly untested products; their claims do not establish local benchmark results.

Use the [ingestion checklist](#ingesting-new-information) when adding or refreshing material.

Short status and version caveats may repeat so independently retrieved pages remain interpretable. Complete task inventories, procedures, result tables, and behavioral contracts have one owner. Within research, use the [ownership map](research/runs-on-sccache/README.md) and link to shared contracts rather than maintaining another checklist.

## Ingesting new information

1. Search existing tool names and aliases, provider names, strategy pages, source URLs, and decision IDs before creating a page. Prefer enriching the existing owner; a newly discovered article is not automatically a new strategy.
2. Use the [ownership map](#canonical-ownership): named implementations belong in tools, combinations and tradeoffs in approaches, provider capabilities and blog sources in providers, storage semantics in concepts, measurements in evidence, procedures in operations or deployments, and unstable work or implementation proposals in research.
3. Record a concise applicability and status statement plus a review date. Distinguish an open-source component usable directly in GitHub Actions from a provider-dependent service, another CI platform, or an unstable experiment. Check the component's actual license and source; a public action does not establish that its backend is open source. Use “not assessed” when unknown.
4. Link primary sources near external claims and record the relevant version, platform, cache layer, backend or protocol, and persistence lifetime. Keep provider timing claims separate from local measurements.
5. Summarize durable new information in its canonical owner and cross-link related tools, strategies, storage, and providers. Preserve contradictory or superseded evidence in context; resolve changed current conclusions through decisions and history. Do not silently turn an upstream fix into a local retest.
6. Link a new page from its category index and directly affected reader routes. Update a decision diagram only when the choice changes, and keep one canonical comparison or result table.
7. Run relevant validation, review the diff for lost source URLs, and confirm that each new page is reachable from this index. Review scope, maturity, and duplicate claims manually; the checker cannot establish factual truth or editorial ownership.

Category indexes and these conventions are the ingestion contract. Extend them only when a recurring ambiguity appears.
