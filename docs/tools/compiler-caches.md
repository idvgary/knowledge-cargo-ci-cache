# sccache vs Mr. Boxington vs Kache

This page owns compiler-cache selection across the three tools. It compares mechanisms and the evidence available here; it is not a three-way benchmark. Adoption status is canonical in [Decisions](../decisions/README.md), and the wider [strategy map](../approaches/README.md) includes Cargo archives, native disks, and container builders.

## Mechanism and support comparison

Source review: 2026-09-15. The source baselines below are newer than some archived experiments. A release's advertised support does not establish that a particular workload is cacheable or correct.

| Rust linking and build scripts | Rust invocations that invoke a linker are not cached; compiling a build-script binary is different from caching its execution.           | Describes native executable, test, and proc-macro support on modelled host toolchains; build-script execution reuse depends on tracked inputs and captured outputs.

Use the [Mr. Boxington action documentation](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev/github-action), [Kache CI guide](https://kunobi.ninja/docs/kache/remote-cache/ci), and [compiler-cache integration diagnostics](../operations/diagnosing-compiler-cache-integration.md) for lifecycle details. Upstream comparison pages describe their authors' workloads; they do not resolve this archive's selection.

## How to compare fairly

Use one wrapper configuration at a time unless an explicitly supported composition is the experiment. Fix source, resolved compiler, target triple, flags, features, profile, build command, runner resources, and trust boundary. Record native dependency and linker coverage; unsupported work still costs time even with a high hit rate.

Measure cold/population, same-source fresh-runner reuse, and changed-source jobs separately. Test a failed build, a missing remote, and a restored cache that contains no useful entries. Verify output correctness and include setup, restore, compilation, linking, export, and teardown. An exact archive hit, same-job warm build, or upstream speedup is insufficient evidence of cross-run benefit. Use the existing [measurement procedure](../operations/measuring-cache-performance.md) and [JSONL contract](../reference/cache-measurement-schema.md).

## Evidence and decision

The [Mr. Boxington vs sccache evidence](../evidence/mr-boxington-vs-sccache.md) owns the historical paired trials; [cache strategy benchmarks](../evidence/cache-strategy-benchmarks.md) own the broader direct-S3 workload. Do not combine their timings into a three-tool ranking. The current selections and candidate statuses remain [D7, D9, and D10](../decisions/README.md).
