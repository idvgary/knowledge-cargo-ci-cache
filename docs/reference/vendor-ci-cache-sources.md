# Rust CI Cache Ecosystem Sources

This reference owns core upstream projects, action wrappers, and historical source links. Provider capabilities and their first-party blog collections live in [Providers](../providers/README.md); mechanism selection lives in the [CI strategy map](../approaches/README.md). Reviewed: 2026-09-06.

## Choose By Cache Layer

Use [cache layers](../concepts/cache-layers.md) to distinguish dependency archives, Cargo target state, compiler objects, native volumes, and container caches. The [strategy map](../approaches/README.md#ci-strategy-map) routes each mechanism to its explanation and provider sources. External benchmarks remain source material; local results belong in [Evidence](../evidence/README.md).

## Provider documentation, actions, and blog posts

The canonical [provider index](../providers/README.md) links focused collections for RunsOn, Namespace, Depot, Blacksmith, WarpBuild, Ubicloud, Actuated, Earthly, and BuildJet. It records explicit deployment limits, article context, untested status, and gaps. Keep provider-specific behavior there rather than duplicating a second wide catalog here.

## `sccache` Upstream Baseline

The [implementation reference](compiler-cache-implementation.md) owns pinned server/client-side, multilevel, OpenDAL, and backend behavior. The [sccache tool profile](../tools/sccache.md) owns configuration and selection; [benchmarks](../evidence/cache-strategy-benchmarks.md) own the measured mode comparisons. A workstation optimization or newly released backend fix does not establish a CI improvement.

## `mr-boxington` Experimental Candidate

The [Mr. Boxington tool profile](../tools/mr-boxington.md) owns version-specific setup. The [paired evidence](../evidence/mr-boxington-vs-sccache.md) separates same-job reuse from fresh-runner restoration. Use the [three-tool comparison](../tools/compiler-caches.md) for capability and evidence differences.

## Kache: not tested

[Kache](https://github.com/kunobi-ninja/kache) remains untested and unadopted here. Its [candidate profile](../tools/kache.md) owns reviewed capabilities, release boundaries, CI/S3/filesystem source links, and qualification needs.

## Applying a source

Follow the [measurement procedure](../operations/measuring-cache-performance.md) when translating a provider claim into an experiment. Use [compiler-cache diagnostics](../operations/diagnosing-compiler-cache-integration.md) for ineffective restores and [maintenance](../operations/maintenance-checklist.md) before changing external assumptions.

## Implication For The Cold-Write Question

The [measured direct-S3 evidence](../evidence/cache-strategy-benchmarks.md) owns the population slowdown and its causal limitations. Provider material motivates transport comparisons; it does not prove that S3 writes caused the whole slowdown. Remaining transport work is tracked once in the [research roadmap](../research/runs-on-sccache/roadmap.md).

## Maintenance

Preserve source URLs when reorganizing this reference or provider profiles. Recheck source date, actual platform, release/interface, maintenance status, and benchmark context. Keep negative findings such as a missing dedicated integration visible, and do not turn a provider's benchmark into a local result.
