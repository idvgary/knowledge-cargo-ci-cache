# Evidence

This category preserves the test setup, observations, and interpretation behind the repository's recommendations. Evidence pages support decisions; they do not own workflow guidance or repeat complete approach descriptions.

## Pages

| Page | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Target archive growth in production](target-archive-growth.md) | Records anonymized whole-target archive growth, degraded restore/save phases, concurrent-save duplication, and PR timing before and after target caching was disabled. |
| [Cache strategy benchmarks](cache-strategy-benchmarks.md) | Compares no Rust cache, input-only caching, whole-target archives, and S3 `sccache` modes on a representative full workload and a controlled benchmark. |
| [`mr-boxington` vs `sccache`](mr-boxington-vs-sccache.md) | Separates same-job, historical path-mapping, corrected mbx 1.11.1, controlled action-transport, and native-S3 trials. |
| [`Swatinem/rust-cache` vs `runs-on/snapshot`](rust-cache-vs-snapshot.md) | Compares restored Cargo state and repeated-build behavior. |
| [Cached worktree and source-keyed target cache](cached-worktree-and-target-cache.md) | Records the source-mtime fix, exact-hit outliers, workaround, and native prototype. |
| [S3 Files experiment](s3-files.md) | Records network-filesystem layouts, timings, setup costs, and interpretation. |

## Evidence Rules

- Record the test shape, observed values, interpretation, and limitations.
- Keep current recommendations and tradeoffs in [`docs/approaches/`](../approaches/README.md).
- Keep procedures in [`docs/operations/`](../operations/README.md).
- Keep dense reusable technical detail in [`docs/reference/`](../reference/README.md) when it would make a first-read page heavy.
- Prefer focused evidence records over a chronological experiment diary.

## Page Shape

Evidence pages follow this order: question, test setup or progression, observations, interpretation, limitations, and implications.
