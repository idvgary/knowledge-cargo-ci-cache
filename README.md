# Knowledge: Cargo CI Cache

A growing knowledge base for LLMs and maintainers researching Rust/Cargo CI caching. Implementation guidance targets open-source components used directly in GitHub Actions; provider articles, other CI platforms, and unstable features remain tracked as research sources. See [scope and evidence rules](docs/README.md#scope-and-applicability).

## Current Answer

For most RunsOn Rust projects, start with mise, Magic Cache, input-only `Swatinem/rust-cache`, and a clean local `target/`. Keep no Rust cache as the control and remove the input cache when measurement shows no material benefit. For changing pull-request workloads whose compile time remains material, canary both S3-backed `sccache` and Mr. Boxington object mode. In a controlled September 16 comparison, mbx 1.12.0 with action 1.4.0 finished seven seconds ahead of sccache and fifteen seconds ahead of the same mbx binary with action 1.3.1. Mr. Boxington target mode was faster in immediate exact-warm tests, but it restores a mutable target tree and has not been qualified against the production lineage that grew from 206 MB to 17.82 GB. Keep it for narrow, stable, monitored workloads until a changed-source soak test establishes bounded growth.

Whole-target archives and native filesystem persistence are situation-specific options. RunsOn now offers managed EBS sticky disks; the custom snapshot action remains archived evidence. The canonical record is [Decisions](docs/decisions/README.md), and the platform mapping is [RunsOn Deployment Map](docs/deployments/runs-on/README.md).
