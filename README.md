# Knowledge: Cargo CI Cache

A growing knowledge base for LLMs and maintainers researching Rust/Cargo CI caching. Implementation guidance targets open-source components used directly in GitHub Actions; provider articles, other CI platforms, and unstable features remain tracked as research sources. See [scope and evidence rules](docs/README.md#scope-and-applicability).

## Current Answer

For most RunsOn Rust projects, start with mise, Magic Cache, input-only `Swatinem/rust-cache`, and a clean local `target/`. Keep no Rust cache as the control and remove the input cache when measurement shows no material benefit. For changing pull-request workloads whose compile time remains material, the leading measured portable compiler-output candidate is a clean target with S3-backed `sccache` in default server mode. A corrected mbx 1.11.1 retest kept sccache ahead of object mode end to end; mbx target mode was faster but restores Cargo target state and is a separate experiment.

Whole-target archives and native filesystem persistence are situation-specific options. RunsOn now offers managed EBS sticky disks; the custom snapshot action remains archived evidence. The canonical record is [Decisions](docs/decisions/README.md), and the platform mapping is [RunsOn Deployment Map](docs/deployments/runs-on/README.md).
